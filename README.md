# UniProt SNP Variation Extractor
This repository contains a Python script designed to automate the retrieval, processing, and categorization of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data for a list of UniProt IDs using the EBI Proteins API. The pipeline retrieves variation data, converts it into CSV format, parses complex nested fields, and categorizes the results based on variation types.
